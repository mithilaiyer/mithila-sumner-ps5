## Step 1: Develop initial scraper and crawler

### 1. Scraping (PARTNER 1)

# 1. Extracts and saves HTML code as a parseable object

```{python}
#Loading in the Enforcement Actions webpage
url = 'https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml')
#We want to find the titles, dates, categories, and links. Lets look at how many there are of each (we actually should know this as the first page lists 20)

#Titles these are under <a> tags in the <h2> tag with class 'usa-card__heading'. First we find h2 tags
h2_tags = soup.find_all('h2', class_='usa-card__heading')

#Then we filter these tags to find the <a> tags and the text within that we need with a loop
titles = [
    a_tag.get_text(strip=True)  
    for h2 in h2_tags  
    for a_tag in h2.find_all('a', href=True) 
    if a_tag['href'].startswith('/')  
]

#Print the # of filtered titles
print(len(titles))
#We have 20 titles - this seems to be on the right track!

#Dates
div_tags = soup.find_all('div', class_='font-body-sm margin-top-1')

#Extracting the text we need from sub-tags with a loop
dates = [
    span.get_text(strip=True)  
    for div in div_tags  
    for span in div.find_all('span', class_='text-base-dark') 
]

#Printing # of filtered dates
print(len(dates))

#Categories 
ul_tags = soup.find_all('ul', class_='display-inline add-list-reset')
#Extracting the text we need from sub-tags with a loop
categories = [
    li.get_text(strip=True)
    for ul in ul_tags 
    for li in ul.find_all('li', class_='usa-tag')
]
#Printing categories for each instance
print(len(categories))

#Links
#Importing url joiner package and setting base url for complete links
from urllib.parse import urljoin
base_url = 'https://oig.hhs.gov'

h2_tags = soup.find_all('h2', class_='usa-card__heading')

#Extracting full links using a loop
full_links = [
    urljoin(base_url, a_tag['href']) 
    for h2 in h2_tags 
    for a_tag in h2.find_all('a', href=True) 
]

#Printing the number of full links found
print(len(full_links))

#Creating dataframe
scraped_data = {'Title': titles, 'Date': dates, 'Category': categories, 'Link': full_links}
scraped_data = pd.DataFrame(scraped_data)

#Printing the head
print(scraped_data.head())

#Source: ChatGPT for extracting all titles, links, etc using a loop, and for looking up how to include entire links using urljoin
```


### 2. Crawling (PARTNER 1)

```{python}
#First we need to get the list of relative links from the main page and store the content in a soup object 
main = 'https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/'
response = requests.get(main)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

#Extracting all the complete links
full_links = [
    urljoin(base_url, a_tag['href'])
    for h2 in soup.find_all('h2', class_='usa-card__heading')
    for a_tag in h2.find_all('a', href=True)
]

#Now we need to loop through each page and create soup objects. From looking at the html on the first page, we know that the agency information is under a <li tag>, which is nested in the <ul tag>
agencies = []
for link in full_links:
    response = requests.get(link)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    ul_tag = soup.find('ul', class_='usa-list') 
    if ul_tag:
        li_tags = ul_tag.find_all('li')
#Based on the hint and from examining the page more closely, we see that the <ul> tag has more than 1 <li> tags - we want the second one, as it holds the agency info
        if len(li_tags) > 1:
            agency_info = li_tags[1].get_text(strip=True)

#Extracting the agency name from the quotes, appending it to previously created empty list
            if 'Agency:' in agency_info:
                agency_name = agency_info.split("Agency:")[1].strip().strip('"')
                agencies.append(agency_name)

#Print the number of agencies found
print(len(agencies))

#Adding agencies to the scraped data
scraped_data['Agency'] = agencies

#Printing head
print(scraped_data.head())

#Source: ChatGPT for help determining how to find information on the second li tag on a page, for understanding how to store agency names in a list and why that is necessary.
```

## Step 2: Making the scraper dynamic

### 1. Turning the scraper into a function 

* a. Pseudo-Code (PARTNER 2)

1. Create a date checker function
    1.1 Ask user for a month and a day 
    1.2 Check user input to make sure that it's >= 2013; if not then ask user to re-enter 
2. Create a scraper 
    2.1 Create an empty soup object for all the content on the page 
    2.2 Extract date text for the dates on the page, checking along the way whether the date matches the condition. If it does, keep going but if it doesn't then stop scraping
    2.3 If it continues, then go to the next page to continue scraping
    2.4 For each date, pick the associated category
3. Combine all the lists into a dataframe 

For these functions, I will use for loops and while loops. 

* b. Create Dynamic Scraper (PARTNER 2)

```{python}
#Create the block of asking the user for a date 
from datetime import datetime 

#Create the function that checks the user date 
def get_dates():
    while True: 
        user_says = input("Enter a date (MM-YY): ")

        try:
            user_date = datetime.strptime(user_says, "%m-%y")
            if datetime(2013,1,1) <= user_date <= datetime.now():
                return user_date
            else:
                print("Date must be after 01-2013 and before today.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid date format. Please use MM-YY")
        
#Create the function that scrapes 
def scraper(user_date): 
    url = "https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/?page="
    page = 1 
    dates = []
    titles = []
    category = []
    links = []
    agency = []
    count = 0
    
    while True: 
        current_url = f"{url}{page}"
        response = requests.get(current_url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser") 

        span_tags = soup.find_all("span", class_="text-base-dark padding-right-105")
        h2_tags = soup.find_all('h2', class_='usa-card__heading')
        ul_tags = soup.find_all('ul', class_='display-inline add-list-reset')

        #If there are no more pages 
        if not soup: 
            break 

        #Scrape the dates 
        for span in span_tags: 
            date_text = span.get_text(strip=True)
            format_date = datetime.strptime(date_text, "%B %d, %Y")

            if format_date >= user_date: 
                dates.append(format_date)
            else:
                break 

        #Scrape the titles 
        for h2 in h2_tags:
            for a_tag in h2.find_all('a', href=True):
                if a_tag["href"].startswith("/"): 
                    title_text = a_tag.get_text(strip=True)
                    titles.append(title_text)
                    count += 1
                if count >= len(dates): 
                    break 
            if count >= len(dates): 
                break
        
        count = 0

        #Scrape the categories 
        for ul in ul_tags:
            for li in ul.find_all('li', class_='usa-tag'):
                category_text = li.get_text(strip=True)
                category.append(category_text)
                count += 1
                if count >= len(dates): 
                    break 
            if count >= len(dates): 
                break
        
        count = 0 

        #Scrape the full links 
        for h2 in h2_tags:
            for a_tag in h2.find_all('a', href=True):
                full_link = urljoin(base_url, a_tag['href'])
                links.append(full_link)
                count += 1
                if count >= len(dates): 
                    break 
            if count >= len(dates): 
                break

        #Move to the next page with pause
        page += 1
        time.sleep(1)

        #Scrape the agency values from the drawn links
        for lk in links:
            response = requests.get(lk)
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
            ul_tag = soup.find('ul', class_='usa-list') 
            if ul_tag:
                li_tags = ul_tag.find_all('li')
                if len(li_tags) > 1:
                    agency_info = li_tags[1].get_text(strip=True)
                    if 'Agency:' in agency_info:
                        agency_name = agency_info.split("Agency:")[1].strip().strip('"')
                        agency.append(agency_name)

        #Create a dataframe 
        scraped = {
            "Dates" : dates,
            "Titles": titles, 
            "Category": category, 
            "Links": links, 
            "Agency": agency
        }

        scraped_df = pd.DataFrame(scraped)

        #Save to a CSV file 
        formatted_date_name = user_date.strftime("%y-%m")
        file_name = f"enforcement_actions_{formatted_date_name}.csv" 
        scraped_df.to_csv(file_name, index=False)

        return scraped_df

#Combine both functions into one single function 
def main(): 
    user_date = get_dates() 
    all_scraped = scraper(user_date)
